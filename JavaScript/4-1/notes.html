    Synchronous JavaScript: As the name suggests synchronous means to be in a
     sequence, i.e. every statement  of the code gets executed one by one

     Asynchronous JavaScript: (immediate execution of the program )Asynchronous code allows the program to be executed 
     immediately where the synchronous code will block further execution of the
     remaining code until it finishes the current one.
